# OceanPulse

An ML-based multi-signal ocean stress prediction system for early detection of marine ecosystem collapse.

## What is OceanPulse?

OceanPulse fuses Sea Surface Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, and Chlorophyll-a into a unified Ecosystem Stress Score for early detection of marine stress events.

Focus region: Arabian Sea (20N, 65E)

## Key Results

July scores 100/100 on the stress scale. June scores 83.8. August scores 91.8. January scores 2.6. The system correctly identifies the Arabian Sea monsoon stress season.

## Data Sources

- Sea Surface Temperature: NASA MUR SST via NOAA ERDDAP
- Dissolved Oxygen: WOA13 Climatology (Garcia et al. 2014)
- Chlorophyll-a: NASA MODIS-Aqua Climatology

## Roadmap

- [x] Phase 1 - Domain research and setup
- [x] Phase 2 - Data collection (SST, DO, Chlorophyll)
- [x] Phase 3 - Master dataset and composite stress score
- [ ] Phase 4 - LSTM Autoencoder anomaly detection
- [ ] Phase 5 - Multi-signal fusion model
- [ ] Phase 6 - Streamlit dashboard
